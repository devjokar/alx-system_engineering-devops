# Postmortem

## Summary

Postmortem for an incident failure that occurred in our application server on the 4th of May 2023. From 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM.

## Timeline

The incident was first disvovered and reported by the software engineer maintaining the application at that point. He goes by the name Agba John Doe. Once he discovered it, he tried making some standard routine fix on it to no avail. Running out of options, he escalated it. So that on exactly one hour from the incident discovery, which will be 1 AM, I got an alert from him.
